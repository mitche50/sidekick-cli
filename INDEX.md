# Skill index

| Skill | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `automating-bug-fixes` | Drives an autonomous bug-fix loop from logs or failing tests to a patch, minimizing micromanagement and emphasizing verification. |
| `delegating-subagents` | Decomposes complex tasks into parallel subagent work across separate LLM sessions, then synthesizes results and runs a gatekeeper review. |
| `developing-reusable-commands` | Turns repeated LLM or router workflows into reusable local CLI commands or scripts with docs, safe defaults, and examples. |
| `explaining-and-quizzing` | Switches into teaching mode by explaining changes, generating diagrams, and running spaced-repetition quizzes while storing learnings locally. |
| `improving-prompts` | Iteratively improves prompts and specs using critique, stricter acceptance criteria, and rewrite cycles to raise output quality. |
| `integrating-local-data-tools` | Integrates local data and analytics CLIs (sqlite3, jq, csv tools) via scripted wrappers so analysis is reproducible and safe-by-default. |
| `maintaining-local-knowledge-base` | Captures lessons learned into a persistent, version-controlled knowledge base and suggests how to inject it into prompts. |
| `optimizing-terminal-environment` | Suggests terminal, tmux, and shell ergonomics to speed task switching across worktrees and LLM sessions in local dev workflows. |
| `parallelizing-workflows` | Guides parallel coding using git worktrees or clones and isolated LLM sessions per task to reduce context bleed. |
| `planning-before-implementation` | Produces a plan-first workflow (plan, review, execute, re-plan) for complex tasks before making code changes. |
