# @mitche50/sidekick-cli

The command-line interface for Sidekick -- your agent's context compiler.

Compiles `AGENTS.md` from modular playbooks and skills so your AI coding agents always have the guidance they need.

## Install

```bash
npm install -g @mitche50/sidekick-cli
```

## Quick start

```bash
sidekick init          # set up .sidekick/ config
sidekick add planning-before-implementation
sidekick build         # compile AGENTS.md
```

Your agents are now equipped. See the [repo README](../../README.md) for full documentation.
